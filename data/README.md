### A note on networks
In the **user-based** network, books are nodes and edges exist between nodes if a user has rated both books. Edges can be _weighted_ or _filtered_. For example, if 100 readers rated both `Animal Farm` and `1984`, we'd draw an edge between those two nodes with a weight of 100. This allows us to filter out edges that might not be relevant. If only 2 readers rated, say, both `Catcher in the Rye` and `Being and Time`, and we filtered out edges with a weight of 2, we'd be excluding that rather improbable connection. The **tag-based networks** do the same thing, except edges exist between two books if they share at least one tag, like `dystopian-fiction` or `could-not-finish`.
