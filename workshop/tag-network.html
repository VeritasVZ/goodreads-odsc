    <h2>Goodreads Tag Network</h2>
    <p>
      Cluster books that have been given the same tags. Books are nodes and edges exist between two nodes
      if they share a tag. Edges can be weighted by the number of tags in common, or some other metric.
      Very common tags, and tags that only appeared a few times, were filtered to avoid creating a huge network,
      which might freeze your browser or at least render very slowly. We ended up with ~400 tags.
      See the Python notebook for more details.
