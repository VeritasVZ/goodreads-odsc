    <h2>Goodreads Ratings History</h2>
    <p>
     Here we plot the historical "quality" of the Goodreads books. How do ratings change for newer or older books?
     We also plot the number of ratings over the book's publishing year to sanity check any trends we see.
     Volatility might be due to a statistically insignificant number of ratings. <strong>Note</strong> that the
     bars are on a different scale from the line. Add a third z-axis to demonstrate this.
