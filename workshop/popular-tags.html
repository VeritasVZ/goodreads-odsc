    <h2>Goodreads Tags by Popularity</h2>
    <p>
      What are the most popular tags on Goodreads? A tag is popular if many <strong>books</strong> have been tagged with it: it has widespread usage.
      But a tag can also be popular if many <strong>readers</strong> have used it, perhaps on only a narrow set of books. For example, there may be
      many instances of the tag "portuguese melancholy", but they might all be attributed to <i>The Book of Disquiet</i>, while the frequency of a
      tag like "ebook" is due to its general application across a wide set of books. To get a sense of how <strong>unique</strong> vs.
      <strong>widespread</strong> a tag is, we can normalize its total usage by the number of books tagged with it.
